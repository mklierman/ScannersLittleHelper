*** Image Manipulation ***

Preview Image should be used whenever possible to speed things up. 
	Get screen resolution and set preview image to that size when in Single Image mode

Source image should not be overwritten unless specifically requested by the user.
	Preview image should be temporary
	"Modified" source image should be a temporary copy until the request to save is sent.
	All temp images and files should be cleaned when navigating to a different image or when application closes.

Option to view "current" source image at any time should be provided.
	It is possible that certain edits would have differing results on the preview image and the source image. eg, anything to do with color (if we provide that)

Option to regenerate preview based on "current" source image.

As edits are applied they should be done to the preview image immediately and then a temporary copy of the source image in the background. 
	We don't want the user waiting for edits to be applied to the source image at the end when saving.
	When saved, the original source image can be replaced with the temp one that edits have been applied to.

It is important that edits are applied in the order the user requests them as they can have an impact on further edits.

Undo stack should be kept current at all times.
